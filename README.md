## Design

### Colour Scheme

![screenshot](documentation/features/colours.png)

**Retro Vibe:** The design features a bold combination of Navy (`#000080`) and LightSkyBlue (`#87CEFA`) as seen in the footer gradient, evoking a nostalgic Windows 98 feel.
**High Contrast:** The dark navbar (`bg-gray-900`) paired with white text and borders ensures excellent readability on large screens.
**Accent Variety:** Subtle Silver (`#C0C0C0`) accents and well-defined hover effects add visual depth without detracting from the retro aesthetic.

### Fonts
The site uses fonts inspired by late 1990‚Äôs Web 1.0 aesthetics. In particular:

We used Tailwind built-in fonts, Serif and Mono, designed for readability with elegant letterforms and extensive language support‚Äîideal for biographies.

### Wireframes
Based on the user stories, we used Balsamiq to design the wireframes for the main UI, starting with mobile first.

## Agile Methodology

### Kanban Board
All user stories were logged on the [Kanban Project Board](https://github.com/users/tgrey2024/projects/21) on GitHub Projects. We used this board during development and testing to track progress, assign priorities, and log significant bugs.

### User Stories
Below are the prioritized user stories for the current implementation:

| User Stories                                    | MoSCoW Priority           |  Status |
|:----------------------------------------------- |:-------------------------:|:-------:|
| User-Friendly Navigation and Responsive Design  | must have                 |   Done  |
| Display Timeline View                           | must have                 |   Done  |
| Header and Footer                               | must have                 |   Done  |

### Header
![Header](documentation/features/header.png)
#### Header Section Overview
The header of this project is designed with a retro-modern and responsive layout to provide easy navigation across the site, with a touch of 1980s. It includes the following key components:
### Structure and Design
#### Background Gradient
* The header has a linear gradient that transitions from a dark blue (#000080) to a light sky blue (#87CEFA), giving it a visually appealing look. The text color is white, ensuring good contrast and readability.
#### Logo
* The logo is placed on the left side and links to the home page. It's styled to ensure that it fits well in the header without distorting or overflowing, using a max-w-full and max-h-full approach.
#### Navigation Links
* The horizontal navigation menu is displayed on larger screens (medium and up, md breakpoint) with links to key pages: Home, Timeline, Mentors, Team, Login and Register. These links have hover effects for better user interaction.
* If the user is authenticated, additional links for "Logout" and "Change Password" are displayed. Otherwise, users will see the "Login" and "Register" options.
### Mobile Responsiveness
* On smaller screens, the navigation links are hidden, and a hamburger menu (navbar-burger) appears.
* When clicked, it toggles a dropdown menu (navbar-dropdown) showing the same navigation links as in the desktop version.
* The dropdown menu is styled to appear below the hamburger button with a light background and rounded corners.
### Footer
![Footer](documentation/features/footer.png)
* The footer is styled with a dark blue background (#000080), white text, and a subtle border on top.

* The text is centered, and the font is set to a monospace style (font-mono), with a small size (text-sm).

* It includes a copyright notice with the text "404 Gender Gap Not Found - Since 1900", followed by "All Rights Reserved".

* This footer is fixed at the bottom of the page (mt-auto), ensuring it stays at the bottom even if content above it is not enough to fill the screen.

### Timeline
* The timeline feature is a tribute to the trailblazing women who have shaped the world of technology through their pioneering achievements, starting with the pioneer, Ada Lovelace, often hailed as the world's first computer programmer. It presents an engaging and interactive journey through history, highlighting key figures and their groundbreaking contributions to fields like computing, engineering, game design, web accessibility and more. Each entry includes a snapshot of their life, notable accomplishments and the lasting impact of their work, providing inspiration for users of all ages. By showcasing these remarkable stories, the timeline not only honours these innovators but also encourages future generations to follow in their footsteps and continue breaking barriers in tech.

#### Read more
* The user is invited to know more about any figure by clicking on the Read more button to find out more about each tech icon.

#### Honor Her - Heart
* Users can honors the women featured on our timeline by giving them a heart - clicking on the heart icon.

### Tips
### Contact Mentor Form
* User may pick a mentor from the pool.
* If no one suites them then they can use the 'Find a mentor' button to send a message to have one assigned.
* Or Connect with their choose Mentor. 
* The system will then try to match the user with a mentor.
### Admin Panel
The Admin Panel is set up for the admin or superuser to access and update the data in the database.

### Custom Error Pages
* We have custom error pages for 400, 403, 404 (example shown) and 500.
![Timeline](documentation/features/cust-error.png)

### Future Features
* Filter for mentors
* CRUD function for mentors
* Allow users to create their own avatar
